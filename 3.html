    <p> hello, i'm pawan. i study in IIT BHU . and it is one of my written poem :
        <h3> dignity</h3>
        You get dignity, When you stop thinking wrong When you do what you learn right You can live dignified, When you live a lifestyle that, matches your vision. You can get dignity when you renounce the “ego of individuality”. and rejoice ups and downs of life. There is dignity, when you have good thoughts, in your heart and mind.
