        <h1> IIT BHU </h1>
        <p>
            IIT (BHU) Varanasi has formerly been known as the Banaras Engineering College (BENCO), the College of Mining
            and Metallurgy (MINMET), the College of Technology (TECHNO) and the Institute of Technology, Banaras Hindu
            University (IT-BHU). Its establishment is intimately linked with that of the Banaras Hindu University (BHU).
            The first convocation ceremony at BHU was held on 2 December 1920. The Chancellor of the University,
            Maharaja Krishnaraja Wadiyar of Mysore who had come to preside over and address the convocation, performed
            the opening ceremony of the Banaras Engineering College (BENCO) Workshop buildings.[5] An Artisan Course was
            started on 11 February 1919. BHU has the credit of first starting degree classes in Mechanical Engineering,
            Electrical Engineering, Metallurgy and Pharmaceutics, thanks to the foresight of its founder, Pt. Madan
            Mohan Malaviya.The Department of Geology was started under BENCO in 1920. Courses in Mining and Metallurgy
            were introduced by the Geology Department. The Department of Industrial Chemistry was started in July, 1921.
            In 1923, Mining and Metallurgy were established as separate departments and in 1944, they were raised to the
            status of a college forming the College of Mining and Metallurgy (MINMET).[5]

            BHU was the first Indian university to introduce the study of Pharmaceutical Chemistry.[5] This initiative
            was taken in 1932 when a new group of subjects for the BSc Examination consisting of (a) Chemistry, (b)
            Botany with Pharmacognosy and (c) Pharmaceutical Studies was started in 1934 and in 1935 a new three-year
            program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Pharmacy was introduced. The science departments of the
            University were under the Central Hindu College. In September 1935, a new College of Science was constituted
            comprising the departments of Physics, Chemistry, Botany, Zoology, Geology, Pharmaceutical Chemistry,
            Industrial Chemistry and Ceramics. In 1937, the Department of Glass Technology also came into existence
            under this college. The year 1939 witnessed the establishment of a separate College of Technology (TECHNO)
            comprising the departments of Industrial Chemistry, Pharmaceutics, Ceramics and Glass Technology,In 1968,
            BENCO, TECHNO and MINMET were merged into one and the Institute of Technology (IT-BHU) was established
            integrating the departments of Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Civil and Municipal
            Engineering, Mining Engineering, Metallurgical Engineering, Chemical Engineering and Technology, Silicate
            Technology and Pharmaceutics. The Department of Silicate Technology subsequently became the Department of
            Ceramic Engineering. A separate Department of Electronics Engineering was also established.[5] The
            departments of Applied Physics, Applied Mathematics and Applied Chemistry were established in 1985.

            The earlier system of regional admission based on merit lists was replaced in 1972 by admission through
            Indian Institute of Technology Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE) for undergraduate courses and Graduate
            Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) for postgraduate courses. In the tenth meeting of IIT Council in 1972,
            it was also proposed to convert the then IT-BHU into an IIT and a committee was appointed by IIT Council for
            the same but because of political reasons, the desired conversion could not be achieved then.[6]

            In 2003, Committees constituted by MHRD (Professors Joshi and Anand Krishnan Committees)[7] had recommended
            for the conversion of the Institute into an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT).[8] On 17 July 2008, the
            government of India issued a press release granting "In principle approval for taking over the Institute of
            Technology, Banaras Hindu University – a constituent unit of the Banaras Hindu University, a Central
            University, its conversion into an Indian Institute of Technology and integrating it with the IIT system in
            the country."[9] The BHU Executive Council approved the proposal of the HRD ministry to convert IT-BHU to
            IIT (BHU) Varanasi, retaining academic and administrative ties to BHU.

            On 4 August 2010 a bill seeking to amend the Institutes of Technology Act 1961 to declare IT-BHU an IIT was
            introduced in the Lok Sabha by Minister of State for HRD, D. Purandeswari.[10][11][12] The Lok Sabha passed
            The Institutes of Technology (Amendment) Act, 2011 on 24 March 2011[13] and the Rajya Sabha on 30 April
            2012, thereby formalizing the IIT status of the Institute.[14] The Bill was signed by the President of India
            on 20 June 2012 and notified in the gazette on 21 June.[15] The Department of Architecture, Planning and
            Design was set up in the Institute in collaboration with IIT Roorkee, beginning its academic activities from
            the session 2019-2020. The first cohort of students consisted of 20 students admitted into the five-year
            programme through the JEE Advanced exam.[16]

            The institute celebrated its centenary year in 2019-2020. It organized a global alumni meet and other
            cultural events during the celebration. The 80-year-old BENCO chimney was also re-erected to commemorate the
            institute's completion of a century
